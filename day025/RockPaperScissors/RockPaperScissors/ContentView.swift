/*
 
 Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
 Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
 The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
 If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
 The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.
 
 */



/*
 
 You‚Äôll need to create two @State properties to store the app‚Äôs current choice and whether the player should win or lose.
 You can use Int.random(in:) to select a random move. You can use it for whether the player should win too if you want, but there‚Äôs an even easier choice: Bool.random() is randomly true or false. After the initial value, use toggle() between rounds so it‚Äôs always changing.
 Create a VStack showing the player‚Äôs score, the app‚Äôs move, and whether the player should win or lose. You can use if shouldWin to return one of two different text views.
 The important part is making three buttons that respond to the player‚Äôs move: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
 Use the font() modifier to adjust the size of your text. If you‚Äôre using emoji for the three moves, they also scale. Tip: You can ask for very large system fonts using .font(.system(size: 200)) ‚Äì they‚Äôll be a fixed size, but at least you can make sure they are nice and big!
